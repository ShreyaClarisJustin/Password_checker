The basic factor that allows a password to remain strong is the criteria that is to be followed. Criteria for a strong password are defined. This typically includes factors like length, the presence of different types of characters (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, special characters). 
A function is implemented to check the password against the defined criteria. This function analyzes the password to see if it meets each criterion and assigns a score based on how many criteria are fulfilled.
The score is calculated based on the number of criteria the password meets.
Depending on the score, feedback is provided to the user indicating whether the password is weak, pretty good, or strong.
